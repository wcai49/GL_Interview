# GL_Interview
## Background
This is a Vue 2.0 project to help WEB Software Engineers who are looking for a new job.
___

Currently I am preparing my job interview with Microsoft. During my last interview with one project group of MS, they asked me to do such things:

1. They showed me an image of CSS Box structure and asked me to make it with raw **HTML** and **CSS** code;

2. They asked me an algorithm question about **Linked List**.

After failing that Interview, I reviewed the whole process and realized that: it will be better to have such a prepared project before I started any interview, **a tool to solve any potential problems** that Frontend Developer might faced.

## Introduction
As a result of that, this project was created for helping Frontend Engineers to prepare their job interviews. Currently, there are 3 main parts(you can easily check them out in the header area, the navigation menu):

1. Demo-page: This is the page for users to show their demonstration. If you have some cool things that you want to show during the interivew, for example I have my 3D unity scene in this area, you can put your magic tricks in this section;

2. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: This section contains 3 online-IDEs for you to finish your frontend tests. You can write raw Frontend stuffs without any Framework like Vue, React, etc.,

3. Algorithms: Sometimes, the algorithms question that the interviewer asked might not be that hard. However, if the question itself is not hard, **you gotta be careful!** 

	For example, during my last interview, they asked a Linked List problem which was easy to me. However, they also asked me to make it **Runnable** , which means that I must code a Linked List data structure by hand. I could not figure it out, therefore I failed, and that is why we have this section.
	
	In this section, you can choose **input/output** type from String, Array, TreeNode, ListNode, etc., Record the problem description in the up-right area, enter your code on the left part, click Run button to execute.

## Some other words:
I do not know how much time it will take for me to finish this project, as a member of Huawei and an owner of a Border Collie dog, time is always being tough. Anyways, good luck to anyone who are looking for a better job, better life.

## Update:
I have successfully passed the interview with Microsoft and I am about to be a member of Microsoft soon! During those 6 rounds of interviews, this project really helped a lot! I wrote several Binary Tree algorithms problems, numbers of Array problems, Linked list, etc., on this project, and every time it worked. This project impressed many of them. I am glad that I have developed such a thing to help myself for the interview, and I wish all the best for people who are trying to get a better life!
