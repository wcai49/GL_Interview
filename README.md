# GL_Interview
A little vue 3.0 project for Frontend developer to use during job interviews.

Currently I am preparing my job interview with Microsoft in Suzhou, China. During my last interview, they asked me to do such things:

1. They wanted me to write some CSS code locally, and I just thought it would be great if I have prepared such a project, just for interview quick coding scenarioes. Instead of being panic, and thought for "how to load a css file for a raw html file" for a while, and finally Googled it during the interview.

2. They asked me a algorithm question about linked list and nodes. That for me, wasn't hard. I figured it out in 2 minutes. However, since it was not a hard problem, they also asked me to run a demo to show that my codes were correct. I couldn't do that, cause I was focusing on how to solve the problem when I was trying to solve leetcode problems, and I have never ever thought about how to make it work, how to simulate the algorithm, especially in websites. So that I think this "playground" liked thing would be helpful for all the Frontend Software Engineers when they are trying to go through a job interview.


I do not know how much time it will take for me to finish this project, as a member of Huawei and an owner of a Border Collie dog, time is always being tough. Anyways, good luck to anyone who are looking for a better job, better life.
