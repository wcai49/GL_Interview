# GL_Interview
## Background
A little vue 2.0 project for Frontend developer to use during job interviews.

Currently I am preparing my job interview with Microsoft in Suzhou, China. During my last interview, they asked me to do such things:

1. They wanted me to write some CSS code locally, and I just thought it would be great if I have prepared such a project, just for interview quick coding scenarioes. Instead of being panic, and thought for "how to load a css file for a raw html file" for a while, and finally Googled it during the interview.

2. They asked me a algorithm question about linked list and nodes. That for me, wasn't hard. I figured it out in 2 minutes. However, since it was not a hard problem, they also asked me to run a demo to show that my codes were correct. I couldn't do that, cause I was focusing on how to solve the problem when I was trying to solve leetcode problems, and I have never ever thought about how to make it work, how to simulate the algorithm, especially in websites. So that I think this "playground" liked thing would be helpful for all the Frontend Software Engineers when they are trying to go through a job interview.


## Introduction
As a result of that, this project was created for helping Frontend-engineers to prepare their job interviews. Currently, there are 3 main parts(you can easily check them out in the header, navigation menu):

1. demo-page: This is the page for user to show their demonstration. If you have some cool stuffs that you want to show during the interivew, for example I have my 3D unity thing in this area, you can put your magic tricks in this section;

2. HTML-CSS-JAVASCRIPT: This page contains 3 online-IDEs for you to finish your frontend tests. It is common to see this kind of interview problem that they will give you a image of some box structrues with different paddings/margins/background-colors, etc., This is the place you can use!

3. Algorithms: The algorithms page provides a huge oneline-IDE for you to code and solve the algorithm problem during the interview. On the right area, you can enter the question's descriptions. Sometimes this is helpful, since ususally you will hear the question for only one time. For the bottom area, you should choose the input type for your function (string, array, listnode, treenode, etc.,). Click [run] button, it will execute your function in the IDE with Input you chose and entered.

## Some other words:
I do not know how much time it will take for me to finish this project, as a member of Huawei and an owner of a Border Collie dog, time is always being tough. Anyways, good luck to anyone who are looking for a better job, better life.

## Update:
I have successfully passed the interview with Microsoft and I am about to be a member of Microsoft soon! During those 6 rounds of interviews, this project really helped a lot! I wrote several Binary Tree algorithms problems, numbers of Array problems, Linked list, etc., on this project, and every time it worked. This project impressed many of them. I am glad that I have developed such a thing to help myself for the interview, and I wish all the best for people who are trying to find a job.
